# readme-template

Repo: https://github.com/curriecoder/readme-template

## Description

This project was motivated by a desire to use command line interface to generate a professional README.md by answering prompts in the terminal. I learned how to install npm packages and create a program in node.js with ES6 as well as gather user data to create the readme.

## Usage

Instructions: Install inquirer and axios with npm. Be sure to npm init and require 'fs' as well as 'util' to have this application work correctly.

## Credits

I would first like to thank the instructors of UPenn LPS Coding Bootcamp class of 08-2021 for continually putting the students at the top of the importance list. Also, thanks to all of my classmates that helped me rubber duck my way through this project. Big thanks to all of GitHub for blazing the trail.
